## Project Description
Welcome to Plantsy! This is the admin side of a plant store management app. The project includes various functionalities that allow administrators to view, add, and manage plant listings. While designers have provided the components and styles, itâ€™s up to me to implement the logic that makes Plantsy functional, interactive, and persistent with backend data.
******
## Project Overview
Plantsy allows users to:

View all plants available in the store.
Add new plants to the inventory.
Mark plants as "sold out" to update their availability.
Delete Plants.
Update plant prices.
Search for plants by name to display a filtered list.
The app's primary goal is to facilitate easy management of plant listings and inventory through intuitive and straightforward functionality.
